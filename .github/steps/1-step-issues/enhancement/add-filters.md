# Prettier Interface

There seems to be no order to the activities. Please fix this.

Here are my ideas, maybe in a toolbar above the activity cards.

- Add some filters, for example by category.
- Add options to sort, for example by name or time.
- Add a free text search.

Obviously, make sure it still looks good on desktop and phone.
