## Step 3: Validating AI-generated code

Great work on implementing the fix with Copilot!

While AI assistants like GitHub Copilot can dramatically improve productivity, it's essential to remember that you are responsible for reviewing and validating all generated code.

> [!tip]
> Whenever working on real projects, use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to setup automated testing for your projects.

### :keyboard: Activity: Review and merge the AI solution

1. Examine the [pull request]({{{pull_request_url}}}) Copilot helped you create.

> âœ¨ **Bonus:** If your access is sufficient, you can ask Copilot to review your code.

1. Once you're satisfied with the changes, merge the pull request

  >  ðŸª§ **Note:** If you are not satisfied, go back to the codespace and work with Copilot to introduce the changes. Remember, coding is an iterative process.

If you encounter issues:

- Make sure the PR was created correctly in the previous step
- If needed, you can navigate directly to your repository on GitHub.com to find the PR
- Remember that while MCP helps Copilot understand your repo better, human review is still essential
