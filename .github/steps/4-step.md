## Step 4: Validating AI-generated code

Great work on implementing that issue! Our extracurricular activities site is getting better every day! ðŸ’š

While AI assistants like GitHub Copilot can dramatically improve productivity, it's essential to remember that **_you_** are responsible for reviewing and validating all work, generated or not.

> [!tip]
> In real projects, many teams use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to setup automated testing.

### :keyboard: Activity: Review and merge the AI solution

1. Examine the [pull request]({{{pull_request_url}}}) Copilot helped you create.

   > âœ¨ **Bonus:** If your Copilot subcription provides it, you can also use a specialised version of Copilot to [review the changes](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review?tool=webui).

2. Once you're satisfied with the changes, merge the pull request and verify the linked issue also closed.

3. Return to VS code and active **Copilot Chat** session.

   > ðŸª§ **Tip:** If you previously clicked Done and need to return to a previous conversation, use the **Show Chats** button at the top of the Copilot Chat panel.

4. Ask Copilot to add a comment to the issue we just finished, and to say thanks for the comments and ideas.

   Some things to check

   - Is your MCP Server still running?
   - Check what information is passed to the MCP server calls - is Copilot using the correct repository?
   - Did Copilot comment on the bug report?

5. Once the comment has been created, Mona will start checking your work. Give her a moment to provide feedback or share the final review. Nice work! You're all done! ðŸŽ‰
